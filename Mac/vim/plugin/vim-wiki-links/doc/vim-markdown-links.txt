*VIM-MARKDOWN-LINKS*

A Vim plugin which eases the navigation between files in a personal wiki.
This project is forked from wikilink and adapted for my own personal wiki
which I maintain in Vim.

1. USAGE                                                           *usage*

Hit the ENTER key when the cursor is on a wiki link
The corresponding file is loaded in the current buffer

2. LINK FORMAT                                               *link-format*
